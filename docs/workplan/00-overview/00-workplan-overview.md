# a5cforge v1 — Specs + Incremental Workplan
SDK → CLI (`git a5c`) → UI (local/remote) → Server webhooks + external orchestration

## Working assumptions
- Repo is the source of truth. `.collab/**` is tracked content.
- All features remain usable **without** policy/signing; verification is additive.
- Deterministic render from a git snapshot is the foundation.
