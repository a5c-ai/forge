# Tests (mandatory)

- Docs correctness checks integrated into CI:
  - link checking (internal links + anchors)
  - markdown linting (style consistency)
  - spellcheck (optional, but recommended for public docs)
- “Docs-driven” acceptance checks:
  - all public commands/APIs referenced in docs exist (or are clearly marked as planned)
  - docs examples are consistent with current CLI help output (snapshot where feasible)
